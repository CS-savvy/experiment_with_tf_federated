## TensorFlow Federated Experiment

This repository is having python scripts to compare the effectiveness of the model trained with federated training methods with Non-federated training methods.

#### Training

1. To train model using TF-Federated, you can `train_tff.py`. You can find the hyperparameters in first few line of code.
2. use `train_keras.py` to start training with usual keras non-federated training.
3. you can also use `train_combined.py` to train one by one both methods with same dataset and model.
